# Film Files

## Description
A MERN stack application for finding and rating movies based on title, year, or actors!

## Motivation
As film enthusiasts, we wanted a place to be able to leave our personal thoughts on movies we enjoyed or otherwise. We also wanted to see what others think about movies they're enjoying as well.
